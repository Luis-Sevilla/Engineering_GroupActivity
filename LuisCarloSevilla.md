## Studying Data

As Professor Raymark mentioned, we generate almost **petabytes** of data per day. These data are now considered as goldmines to not only just Data Scientist but also people in businesses, politics, medical field, and many more. Data can be used to solidify studies and help create solutions to modern day problems and even for personal use but in order to do so the process of analyzing and sorting data must be done to create meaningful information. TEST

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
