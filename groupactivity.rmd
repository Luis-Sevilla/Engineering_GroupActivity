## Studying Data

As Professor Raymark mentioned, we generate almost **petabytes** of data per day. These data are now considered as goldmines to not only just Data Scientist but also people in businesses, politics, medical field, and many more. Data can be used to solidify studies and help create solutions to modern day problems and can even be used for personal use but in order to do so the process of analyzing data must be done to draw meaningful information out of the pool of unsorted data.

## Application of Data Science

### Policy-making

A great example of instances that data science contributed to policy-making is the action that the government did in response to the recent COVID-19 virus outbreak. Analyzing patterns and data from the pandemic helped law-makers and officials to mandate certain ordinance and policy to certain areas of our country. The decision of government officials to raise certain community quarantine rules was due to the analysis of the data they gathered from people who contracted the said virus. 


### Day to Day Decisions

Weather Forecast is one of the major factor that affects our day to day decision. It affects what we wear, what we eat, where should we go, and many more. Weather Forecast uses data science in order to accurately predict the weather in a certain period of time. 


### Market Trends

The recent boom of NFT (**Non-Fungible Token**) investors have stormed the internet and inspired millions of people to invest to these new "**internet currency**". Similar to stock market, the analysis of market trends are what investors are continuously monitoring in order for them to act whether they should sell their NFT or if they would buy more. People who have great knowledge about the market trends and people who analyze data that they can easily gather from the internet are the ones who greatly benefit and earn larger return. 

### Scientific Research

Every content we consume in the internet---or anything technology related--- has been influenced or structured by Data Science to be optimized to its greatest capability. One application that we hold near and dear to our hearts is the **Autocomplete** function that we can find in search engines such as Google, Bing, DuckduckGO, and many more. The autocomplete function was first developed by Kevin Gibbs who sought to create a URL Completion algorithm but later developed to be the autocomplete function we know and love. It was created with the intention of taking advantage of the technological affordances of time to make web navigation more efficient. The algorithm of this function is based on the numerous search queries of millions of the Google search engines users. It was later then optimized with the help of **Artificial Intelligence** to be further accurate not only based on the queries of other users but to also cater the interest and search history of the user.

## Data Science and Chess


Chess can be a rather difficult and complex game and is played by millions of people all over the world. Recently, there has been a massive spike of players in online chess sites such as [Lichess.com](lichess.com), [Chess.com](Chess.com), and many more. [Lichess.com](lichess.com) has given a online data set of game statistics that is free to use. This data set includes 20,000 matches worth of the following data:

* Win rate of White and Black
* Opening Strategy Used 
* Number of Turns per Game
* Player's Rating


Here is a snippet of data values:



```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
chess <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luis-Sevilla/Engineering_GroupActivity/master/chess-games.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
knitr::kable(chess)
```


I propose to use these data to influence the decision making of a player based on the opening the opponent uses. In chess, the opening move is---I argue---one of the crucial and game-deciding part. It will show which player  will be taking hold of the game. Choosing the proper opening can be crucial especially when your opponent is skilled enough to make use of the instances of the openings bring. Analyzing the data shown above, we can gather meaningful information out of the pattern that arises out of the data set and act accordingly. The method that will be used in the study would be [Prescriptive Analysis](https://www.sisense.com/glossary/prescriptive-analytics/) so that information drawn out of the studies could give players proper insights to what opening should the player use and/or how the player will respond to the opponent's opening.

## Importance of analyzing data

We need to study and analyze data because it is an essential factor not only in the business environment but also in our daily life. It's not only useful for businesses to assess their place in the market and to help them make business decisions. The same thing can be applied in our day to day life. 

## Applications of Data Science

### Policy-making

Helps in creating more productive and successful public policies. Data-based arguments are given by policy makers to provide solutions for public problems.

### Day-to-day decisions

Ordering from an online platform such as shopee or lazada. Data analysis helps us determine from where we will buy our ordered product, which has good reviews, which has bad ones, it helps us determine whether a product has a good quality, whether the shop’s owner is accomodating, etc. It helps us make better decisions while ordering online.
 
 ![Online Shopping](https://thesciencesurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/F11173EF-9769-4152-849C-5F35E5BEFF87-1-2-900x675.png)
 
### Knowing market trends

Deciding which stock to invest for in the stock market. Analyzing the market trends helps traders to determine the future of the stock market. Through data analysis, and studying previous trends aids traders in predicting the trend of a stock, whether its trend will continue or decrease. This information helps them in investing in the right stock to avoid having loss and maximize profit.

## Data Science Topic

### The relationship between product reviews and customers' decision on ordering the product

The topic deals with analyzing the relationship between product ratings and the tendency for people to buy such high rated products. It aims to see whether product reviews really persuade people’s decision on buying things online. The data needed for the research can be found on shopping platforms such as shopee and lazada as well as conducting personal surveys to generate our own data. Since the topic deals with finding the relationship between two factors, a correlation statistical method such as pearson r would be used to analyze the data. People who rely on online shopping will mostly benefit from this study as it will aid them in deciding their next purchase and hopefully help them avoid ordering low quality products.

## Reason to Study Data

We need to measure and monitor our performance to produce data. These data can be analyzed later on to produce trends or gaps. Analyzing data will make trends and possible problems more noticeable. That way improvements can be made based on conclusions from the data.

## Possible Data Science Topic

### Do video games really improve hand-eye coordination?

#### Method

Take a set of people who play video games and people who don’t play video games. For the people who play video games, also include what games they usually play. (rhythm, rpg, platformer, hack n’ slash, strategy, etc.)

Both parties need to be tested based on their hand eye coordination. It cannot be video game related because that will make it biased nor can it be too strenuous (it’s not about athleticism).

#### Metrics

* Accuracy
* Reflex
* Control
* Attention to Detail

Providing a proper healthcare system is one of the government's duties and data science is used to create policies related to healthcare. Such agencies like FDA use big data and analyze them in regulating drugs and food products that are going in and out of the country to ensure that these goods that will be released to the market are safe for consumers use.

### Day-to-Day Decisions

Travel/Traffic applications such as Waze and Google Maps help drivers find their desired location and directions towards it. Also, it helps them know whether there is traffic up ahead their way and redirect them to roads which have less traffic.

### Knowing Marketing Trends
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*s2u0cA0oO34TV9qK.jpg)

Business giants such as Amazon use recommendation based systems that uses big data in determining what their users wants, processes it, then streamlines it to encourage the user to buy the said product. Also, they utilized data gathered from users searches, needs, and personal details in recommending products that are suitable to the users situation. This also allowed them to determine when and what time users usually order which helped them improve their shipping capabilities. 

### Scientific Researches

## Possible Data Science Topic

### Strategizing in Football using Data Science
![](https://www.sportsvideo.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OSORIO.png)

Top European football teams (eg. Manchester City, FC Barcelona, Liverpool etc.) have hired talented data scientists or partnered with data intelligence companies for long term research projects related to player performance, development and recruitment as well as opponent scouting. Due to the availability and volume of this data, whether it is physical or video data, data science allows them to analyze these data in a way that would fit with the team's desired playing style or strategy. This gives them an added advantage.

After recently watching Azkals performance during the Asian and World Cup qualifiers, it seems to me that they know less about the teams that they are facing especially teams that are actually better than us on paper and in real life. In studying how the European teams analyze these kind of data and applying it the the system, maybe we could get much better results in the future. This mostly consists of descriptive and inferential analysis because it is both studying data about our own players and opponents and using them to develop a system that could match much better teams in the future.

##Why We Need to Study and Analyze Data

Data, especially in our time and age has grown increasingly relevant as the capacity of the creation of info and data has greatly increased due to the improvement of technology. Because of machines, not only was the creation of data increased, but as well as the variety of the different kinds of data that can be collected and gathered that wasn't possible before.In short, with how data is so relevant in our everyday lives, it can be used to improve our lives. From the smallest things such as grocery prices or to more pressing issues like death rates, Data can be used to discover what the problem is and how to tackle it.

## Applications of Data Science

### Policy-Making
Lawmakers can study the data of which places have the most car accidents or crimes in order to know which places need to have more enforced laws.

### Day-to-Day Decisions
One example could be of when drivers choose to refuel their vehicles and where they do it. Nowadays it is very easy to see and compare the different oil prices of different dates and different brands which is helpful in making these decisions for drivers.

### Marketing Trends
One of the most important data for companies would be personal data that can be tracked by apps and sites online. These personal data will then be used by advertizers in order to cater to the user and make relevant ads appear for them.

### Scientific Researches
Keeping track of data is very useful for zoologists who need to keep track of populations of animals. Aside from populations there are also different kinds of data that are valuable as well such as the ratio of males to females of a certain species, the birthrate of a certain species, and plenty of others more.

## Science Topic Proposal

### The amount of money people could have saved if they bought their food instead of ordering it.

Perhaps one of the most trending habits these last years is ordering food at the comfort of your home instead of going out to buy it for yourself. However we all know that there's a price for this convenience, and it's the increased price of the food and additional delivery fee. The aim of this topic is to find out how much money would a person have been able to save in the span of a year if they instead went out and bought their food themselves. A lot of controlled variables will be taken in to consideration here however including ways of transportation to the restaurant taken by the person and etc. The desired outcome of this topic would be that perhaps finding out the amount of money one would have saved would encourage people to buy their food by themselves again and in turn make them go out of their house more often as well.
